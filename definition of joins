Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This is super useful when your data is spread across multiple tables but you want to see it together.

  1.inner join:

Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.

If a row in one table doesn’t have a matching row in the other, it’s excluded.

  2.left join:

  Returns all rows from the left table, plus matched rows from the right table.

If there’s no match, the right table columns return NULL.

  3.right join:

Returns all rows from the right table, plus matched rows from the left table.

If no match, left table columns return NULL.

  4.FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from both tables.

Rows without matches in the other table will have NULLs in the missing side.

  5. CROSS JOIN

Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (every row from the first table combined with every row from the second).

Be careful, this can produce a huge number of rows!
